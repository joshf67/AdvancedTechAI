During this week i have made minor changes to my AI system, i have added a cover peaking feature to high cover which is slightly broken but does the job, I have also added 3 options to the waypoint system which allows the user to select whether they want the unit to slow-walk/walk or run between nodes, I have optimized the way objects find cover and tidyed up part my code so it's readable. for next week i am going to add a FOV cone on the units, fix the buggy peaking, give the user the ability to damage enemies and make enemies damage the units/players. As a stretch goal i would like to implement formation options for the units and tidy up the rest of the code.
