This week i have added simple AI squad navigation to my project, i have done this by creating a pathing system that a unit can traverse. This path can then be sent to objects following it with a delay, The delay will cause each object to spaced roughly that time in seconds away from eachother. 
I have also attempted to create my own navigation mesh using raycasting to test positions in the world, this is nowhere near as efficient as unity's navmesh system however it allows me to create a navigation area based on what object it has hit and it also allows me to store which objects are in the way.
