During this week i have implemented a cover system into my AI this works by polling each cover point of cover in the scene and tests wether an enemy can see it or not and applies a increase to the cost, the ai then navigates to the closest/cheapest point, if the ai is part of a squad it will try to seek out the closest cover to the squad leader/actor it is following. I have also implemented a selection tool and ui for the previous weeks waypoint system.
Throughout the week i have also been adding onto my previous navigation system to see if it would be wise to use this for 3D navigation instead of using unity's navmesh system, so far i have managed to decrease the generation time of the area by about 3x however it still has the overhead of the previous system requireing a class for each position in the grid, as of now a 100cubed grid with a radius of 0.25 requires 4m grid positions and i believe if i can shorten this the actual size of all the objects i believe i can knock off about 70% of this overhead which may increase the generation time up to 5x.
